AARFS
=====

AARFS can fuse data from AIS and APAR radar to improve the ship scheduling efficiency. The AARFS system consists of two parts: first it implements the data fusion algorithm, second it implements a data generator to simulate the ontime ship navigation to generate the needed ship info.
